# Liquid-Intake-Monitoring-Data
We collected data for 10 different beverages, including water and 5 different volumes, with our LIDS(Liquid Intake Detection System). "Distance" is the distance between the sensor and the liquid surface. "Temperature" is the measured temperature inside the bottle. "Red", "Green", and "Blue" are the values measured by the RGB color sensor for each liquid. "Intensity" is the transformation of Red, Green, Blue to Grayscale. "Lightsetting" and "Light" indicate the lighting condition for each round of data collection. "Type" is our label for each tested liquid. "Volume" is the actual volume of each data collection round.
